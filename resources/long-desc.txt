For Android developers: 

It is slightly annoying when you develop that your Android phone goes to sleep. Or 
alternatively that when you charge it the screen stays on because of a development settings. 

This app will keep your screen on during develop by listening to ADB notifications. It starts keeping your phone awake when a ADB "USB 
debugging connected" notification appears. It will allow your phone sleep again when the notification disappears.

A first release to the store: I helps my development, hopefully it can help yours too.
